This hands-on-lab is about machine learning. 
it's all about using simple linear regression to predict the number of Co2 emissions
Testing which of the x variable is a good predictor of Co2 emission
Training and testing a model to predict the Co2 emissions
Calculating the R2 mean error, the mean absolute value,e.t.c to check the accuracy of the model
